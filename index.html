      <h1>Git in the Groove and Let the Code times Roll</h1>
      <p> Hello World! My name is Subhash and I came here from BASH. I am happy to show all you guys what I've learned so far and would love some feedback.</p>
      <h2><background color= "coral"> List of things that I found challenging at first:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#cli"> CLI</a></li>
        <li><a href="#gitconnect"> Connecting to Git</a></li>
        <li><a href="#prompts"> CUI Prompts</a> </li>

        <div id= "cli">
          <p class= "command">A CLI (command line interface) is a user interface to a computer's operating system or an application in which the user responds to a visual prompt by typing in a command on a specified line, receives a response back from the system, and then enters another command, and so forth.</p>

        </div>
        <div id= "gitconnect">

          <p class= "connect">Connecting to Git is easy but can be frustrating at times. You need to have certain applications downloaded into your computer and you will also need a github account. Once you are all set up, its actually pretty easy to store all your directories.. even in a remote folder.You can learn more about Github and its connection issues <a href= "https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/"> here </a>
<div id ="prompts">
  <p class= "prompts">Command Prompt is used to execute entered commands. Most of those commands are used to automate tasks via scripts and batch files, perform advanced administrative functions, and troubleshoot and solve certain kinds of Windows issues. </p>
